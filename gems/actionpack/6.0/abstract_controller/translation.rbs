module AbstractController::Translation
  # Delegates to <tt>I18n.translate</tt>. Also aliased as <tt>t</tt>.
  #
  # When the given key starts with a period, it will be scoped by the current
  # controller and action. So if you call <tt>translate(".foo")</tt> from
  # <tt>PeopleController#index</tt>, it will convert the call to
  # <tt>I18n.translate("people.index.foo")</tt>. This makes it less repetitive
  # to translate many keys within the same controller / action and gives you a
  # simple framework for scoping them consistently.
  def translate: (untyped key, **untyped options) -> untyped
  alias t translate
  # Delegates to <tt>I18n.localize</tt>. Also aliased as <tt>l</tt>.
  def localize: (untyped object, **untyped options) -> untyped
  alias l localize
