module ActionController::ParameterEncoding::ClassMethods
  def inherited: (untyped klass) -> untyped

  def binary_params_for?: (untyped action) -> untyped
  # Specify that a given action's parameters should all be encoded as
  # ASCII-8BIT (it "skips" the encoding default of UTF-8).
  #
  # For example, a controller would use it like this:
  #
  #   class RepositoryController < ActionController::Base
  #     skip_parameter_encoding :show
  #
  #     def show
  #       @repo = Repository.find_by_filesystem_path params[:file_path]
  #
  #       # `repo_name` is guaranteed to be UTF-8, but was ASCII-8BIT, so
  #       # tag it as such
  #       @repo_name = params[:repo_name].force_encoding 'UTF-8'
  #     end
  #
  #     def index
  #       @repositories = Repository.all
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The show action in the above controller would have all parameter values
  # encoded as ASCII-8BIT. This is useful in the case where an application
  # must handle data but encoding of the data is unknown, like file system data.
