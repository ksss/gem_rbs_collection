module ActionController::Renderers::ClassMethods
  # Adds, by name, a renderer or renderers to the +_renderers+ available
  # to call within controller actions.
  #
  # It is useful when rendering from an ActionController::Metal controller or
  # otherwise to add an available renderer proc to a specific controller.
  #
  # Both ActionController::Base and ActionController::API
  # include ActionController::Renderers::All, making all renderers
  # available in the controller. See <tt>Renderers::RENDERERS</tt> and <tt>Renderers.add</tt>.
  #
  # Since ActionController::Metal controllers cannot render, the controller
  # must include AbstractController::Rendering, ActionController::Rendering,
  # and ActionController::Renderers, and have at least one renderer.
  #
  # Rather than including ActionController::Renderers::All and including all renderers,
  # you may specify which renderers to include by passing the renderer name or names to
  # +use_renderers+. For example, a controller that includes only the <tt>:json</tt> renderer
  # (+_render_with_renderer_json+) might look like:
  #
  #   class MetalRenderingController < ActionController::Metal
  #     include AbstractController::Rendering
  #     include ActionController::Rendering
  #     include ActionController::Renderers
  #
  #     use_renderers :json
  #
  #     def show
  #       render json: record
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # You must specify a +use_renderer+, else the +controller.renderer+ and
  # +controller._renderers+ will be <tt>nil</tt>, and the action will fail.
  def use_renderers: (*untyped args) -> untyped
  alias use_renderer use_renderers
