  # These are used to generate the dynamic forms that implement non-remote links with
  # <tt>:method</tt>.
  #
  # You don't need to use these tags for regular forms as they generate their own hidden fields.
  #
  # For AJAX requests other than GETs, extract the "csrf-token" from the meta-tag and send as the
  # "X-CSRF-Token" HTTP header. If you are using rails-ujs this happens automatically.
