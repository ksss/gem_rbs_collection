  # Looping through a collection of records from the database (using the
  # +all+ method, for example) is very inefficient since it will try to
  # instantiate all the objects at once.
  #
  # In that case, batch processing methods allow you to work with the
  # records in batches, thereby greatly reducing memory consumption.
  #
  #   Person.in_batches.each_record do |person|
  #     person.do_awesome_stuff
  #   end
  #
  #   Person.where("age > 21").in_batches(of: 10).each_record do |person|
  #     person.party_all_night!
  #   end
  #
  # If you do not provide a block to #each_record, it will return an Enumerator
  # for chaining with other methods:
  #
  #   Person.in_batches.each_record.with_index do |person, index|
  #     person.award_trophy(index + 1)
  #   end
  def each_record: () { (untyped) -> untyped } -> untyped
  # Yields an ActiveRecord::Relation object for each batch of records.
  #
  #   Person.in_batches.each do |relation|
  #     relation.update_all(awesome: true)
  #   end
