module ActiveRecord::Relation::RecordFetchWarning
  # When this module is prepended to ActiveRecord::Relation and
  # +config.active_record.warn_on_records_fetched_greater_than+ is
  # set to an integer, if the number of records a query returns is
  # greater than the value of +warn_on_records_fetched_greater_than+,
  # a warning is logged. This allows for the detection of queries that
  # return a large number of records, which could cause memory bloat.
  #
  # In most cases, fetching large number of records can be performed
  # efficiently using the ActiveRecord::Batches methods.
  # See ActiveRecord::Batches for more information.
