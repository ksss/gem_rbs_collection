module ActiveRecord::SignedId
  # Returns a signed id that's generated using a preconfigured +ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier+ instance.
  # This signed id is tamper proof, so it's safe to send in an email or otherwise share with the outside world.
  # It can further more be set to expire (the default is not to expire), and scoped down with a specific purpose.
  # If the expiration date has been exceeded before +find_signed+ is called, the id won't find the designated
  # record. If a purpose is set, this too must match.
  #
  # If you accidentally let a signed id out in the wild that you wish to retract sooner than its expiration date
  # (or maybe you forgot to set an expiration date while meaning to!), you can use the purpose to essentially
  # version the signed_id, like so:
  #
  #   user.signed_id purpose: :v2
  #
  # And you then change your +find_signed+ calls to require this new purpose. Any old signed ids that were not
  # created with the purpose will no longer find the record.
