  #
  # Use this method to shell out to a system library (e.g. mupdf or ffmpeg) for preview image
  # generation. The resulting tempfile can be used as the +:io+ value in an attachable Hash:
  #

  #       draw "my-drawing-command", input.path, "--format", "png", "-" do |output|
  #         yield io: output, filename: "#{blob.filename.base}.png", content_type: "image/png"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The output tempfile is opened in the directory returned by ActiveStorage::Downloading#tempdir.
