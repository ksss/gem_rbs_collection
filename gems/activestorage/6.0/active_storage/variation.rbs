class ActiveStorage::Variation
  # Returns a Variation instance based on the given variator. If the variator is a Variation, it is
  # returned unmodified. If it is a String, it is passed to ActiveStorage::Variation.decode. Otherwise,
  # it is assumed to be a transformations Hash and is passed directly to the constructor.
  def self.wrap: (untyped variator) -> untyped
  # Returns a Variation instance with the transformations that were encoded by +encode+.
  def self.decode: (untyped key) -> untyped
  # Returns a signed key for the +transformations+, which can be used to refer to a specific
  # variation in a URL or combined key (like <tt>ActiveStorage::Variant#key</tt>).

  def initialize: (untyped transformations) -> void
  # Accepts a File object, performs the +transformations+ against it, and
  # saves the transformed image into a temporary file. If +format+ is specified
  # it will be the format of the result image, otherwise the result image
  # retains the source format.
  def transform: (untyped file, ?format: untyped?) ?{ () -> untyped } -> untyped
  # Returns a signed key for all the +transformations+ that this variation was instantiated with.
