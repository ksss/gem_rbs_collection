class Object < ::BasicObject
  # An object is blank if it's false, empty, or a whitespace string.
  # For example, +false+, '', '   ', +nil+, [], and {} are all blank.
  #
  # This simplifies
  #
  #   !address || address.empty?
  #
  # to
  #
  #   address.blank?
  #
  # @return [true, false]
  def blank?: () -> untyped
  # An object is present if it's not blank.
  #
  # @return [true, false]
  def present?: () -> untyped
  # Returns the receiver if it's present otherwise returns +nil+.
  # <tt>object.presence</tt> is equivalent to
  #
  #    object.present? ? object : nil
  #
  # For example, something like
  #
  #   state   = params[:state]   if params[:state].present?
  #   country = params[:country] if params[:country].present?
  #   region  = state || country || 'US'
  #
  # becomes
  #
  #   region = params[:state].presence || params[:country].presence || 'US'
  #
  # @return [Object]
  def presence: () -> (self | nil)
  # Alias of <tt>to_s</tt>.
  def to_param: () -> untyped
  # Converts an object into a string suitable for use as a URL query string,
  # using the given <tt>key</tt> as the param name.

  def as_json: (?untyped? options) -> untyped
  # An elegant way to factor duplication out of options passed to a series of
  # method calls. Each method called in the block, with the block variable as
  # the receiver, will have its options merged with the default +options+ hash
  # provided. Each method called on the block variable must take an options
  # hash as its final argument.
  #
  # Without <tt>with_options</tt>, this code contains duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :customers, dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :products,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :invoices,  dependent: :destroy
  #     has_many :expenses,  dependent: :destroy
  #   end
  #
  # Using <tt>with_options</tt>, we can remove the duplication:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do |assoc|
  #       assoc.has_many :customers
  #       assoc.has_many :products
  #       assoc.has_many :invoices
  #       assoc.has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It can also be used with an explicit receiver:
  #
  #   I18n.with_options locale: user.locale, scope: 'newsletter' do |i18n|
  #     subject i18n.t :subject
  #     body    i18n.t :body, user_name: user.name
  #   end
  #
  # When you don't pass an explicit receiver, it executes the whole block
  # in merging options context:
  #
  #   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options dependent: :destroy do
  #       has_many :customers
  #       has_many :products
  #       has_many :invoices
  #       has_many :expenses
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # <tt>with_options</tt> can also be nested since the call is forwarded to its receiver.
  #
  # NOTE: Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to their own.
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     with_options if: :persisted?, length: { minimum: 50 } do
  #       validates :content, if: -> { content.present? }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The code is equivalent to:
  #
  #   validates :content, length: { minimum: 50 }, if: -> { content.present? }
  #
  # Hence the inherited default for +if+ key is ignored.
  #
  # NOTE: You cannot call class methods implicitly inside of with_options.
  # You can access these methods using the class name instead:
  #
  #   class Phone < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     enum phone_number_type: [home: 0, office: 1, mobile: 2]
  #
  #     with_options presence: true do
  #       validates :phone_number_type, inclusion: { in: Phone.phone_number_types.keys }
  #     end
  #   end
  #

  # A duck-type assistant method. For example, Active Support extends Date

  # <tt>acts_like_time?</tt>. As a result, we can do <tt>x.acts_like?(:time)</tt> and
