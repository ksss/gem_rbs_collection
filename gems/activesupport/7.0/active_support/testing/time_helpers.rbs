  # Dates are taken as their timestamp at the beginning of the day in the
  # application time zone. <tt>Time.current</tt> returns said timestamp,
  # and <tt>Time.now</tt> its equivalent in the system time zone. Similarly,
  # <tt>Date.current</tt> returns a date equal to the argument, and
  # <tt>Date.today</tt> the date according to <tt>Time.now</tt>, which may
  # be different. (Note that you rarely want to deal with <tt>Time.now</tt>,
  # or <tt>Date.today</tt>, in order to honor the application time zone
  # please always use <tt>Time.current</tt> and <tt>Date.current</tt>.)
  #
  # Note that the usec for the time passed will be set to 0 to prevent rounding
  # errors with external services, like MySQL (which will round instead of floor,
  # leading to off-by-one-second errors).
